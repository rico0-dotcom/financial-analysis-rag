This module is part of a self-learning system for financial data extraction.

So Question arises What does this module do?

It watches. It learns. It never sleeps.
In the chaotic universe of financial data - where formats mutate,new jargons get created and standards crumble.We built something....different. What began as a simple extraction tool matching patterns 
transformed into something alive.

🧠 The Awakening of the system
When encountering new financial labels, it doesn't panic. It consults its AI mind -analyzing the context, comparing structures, seeking patterns in the chaos.

🤖 Confident Action
When certainty exceeds 95%, it acts decisively. New mappings become instant knowledge. Dynamic patterns form. The system evolves in real-time.

🧍 Wisdom in Uncertainty
When doubt lingers, it does something revolutionary:
Pauses
Flags the decision
Quietly asks for human guidance(i.e it Enables HITL)
And remembers every correction with perfect recall.

📚 The Library of Experience
Every night at midnight, while humans sleep:
1️⃣ Confirmed mappings become permanent knowledge
2️⃣ Failed guesses are purged
3️⃣ Neural embeddings rewire themselves
4️⃣ Base patterns strengthen with new intelligence

The Evolution
With every passing day:

Human interventions decreases

Mapping accuracy increases exponentially

Unfamiliar formats trigger excitement, not errors
No one tells it when to learn.
No one schedules its training.
It just... does.

We haven't just automated finance.
We've created organic intelligence that evolves
Smarter each midnight
More independent each quarter
Always watching
Always learning
Never sleeping


Key technical of Self-Learning Mechanics:
Real-Time Learning Loop

High-confidence decisions → Immediate pattern reation

Human corrections → Priority knowledge embedding

All outcomes → Training dataset growth

Confirmed mappings become permanent base patterns

Dynamic patterns reset for fresh learning

BERT embeddings rebuild with new knowledge

Priority weights rebalanced based on usage

Adaptive Intelligence Framework
